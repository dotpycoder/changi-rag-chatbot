Automated Immigration Clearance GST Refund Reporting Cash Automated Immigration Clearance For express immigration self-clearance, travellers can use the automated gates. All travellers can enjoy the convenience of automated clearance when they depart Singapore via Changi Airport if their biometrics have been enrolled during arrival immigration clearance. Travellers can use automated clearance as long as they hold a valid International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO) compliant passport. For more information, please refer to ICA’s website GST Refund GST Refund When you buy goods in Singapore, you are required to pay GST on your purchases if the retailer is registered for GST. The Tourist Refund Scheme (TRS) allows you to claim a refund of the GST that you paid on goods purchased from the participating retailers if they are brought out of Singapore via Changi Airport or Seletar Airport, subject to the criteria and conditions of the scheme. How does the Electronic Tourist Refund Scheme (eTRS) work? The Tourist Refund Scheme (TRS) allows eligible tourists to claim a refund of the GST that you paid on goods purchased from the participating retailers if they are brought out of Singapore via Changi Airport or Seletar Airport. To be eligible for a GST refund under this scheme, you must satisfy all the following criteria: You are 16 years of age or above on the date of the purchase; You are not a citizen or a permanent resident of Singapore; You are not a member of the crew of an aircraft on which you are departing Singapore; and You are not a Specified Person* - on the date of the purchase; at any time within the period of 3 months immediately before the date of purchase; or on the date you submit your claim for a refund of the GST charged on your purchases at the airport; *For the definition of Specified Person, please refer to the GST Refund Guide for Visitors on Tourist Refund Scheme (link below) The eTRS is a paperless process; you will not receive any eTRS ticket, and purchases will be tagged to your passport. If you wish to claim GST Refund on your purchases, you should present your passport to the retailers upon payment. To review or select your purchases for GST Refund, you may wish to visit the e-services portal at https://touristrefund.sg . Applying for GST Refund can be done at GST Refund facilities at the terminal of your departure. For claims on items to be checked-in, GST Refund has to be done before your flight check-in. For claims on hand-carried items, GST Refund has to be done in departure transit after clearing immigration. Don’t forget to collect your original receipt or invoice before leaving the shop. Which retailers participate in eTRS? As eTRS is a voluntary scheme, not all retailers in Singapore operate the scheme. GST-registered retailers may choose to operate the scheme on their own or engage the services of a Central Refund Agency. There are currently three Central Refund Agencies in Singapore: Global Blue Singapore Pte. Ltd. Global Blue retailers affiliated with this agency display a 'Global Blue' sign in their shops. Website: http://www.globalblue.com/ Global Tax Free Pte. Ltd. Global Tax Free retailers affiliated with this agency display a 'Global Tax Free' sign in their shops. Website: http://www.global-taxfree.com.sg Retailers who operate the scheme on their own usually display signs that indicate 'Tax Refund' in their shops. However, it is best that you check with the retailers if they are operating the scheme. How much GST refund can I receive? The actual amount refunded may be lesser than the GST you have paid as a handling fee for the refund service will be deducted by the retailer, Central Refund Agency or operator of Central Refund Counter. How do I obtain my GST refund? Do arrive at the airport early to allow sufficient time for your GST refund to be processed and goods to be inspected, if necessary. You are required to seek endorsement at the Customs Inspection Counter in the terminal where you will be checking-in your goods or where your flight will be departing from. You must also depart with the goods on a flight within 12 hours after obtaining approval of your GST refund. For check-in items: Prior to checking-in the goods, please proceed to the eTRS self-help kiosk at the Departure Check-in Hall (before Departure Immigration) to apply for GST Refund. For hand-carried items: Please proceed to the eTRS self-help kiosk at Departure Transit Lounge (after Departure Immigration) to apply for GST Refund.

As a Gold/Platinum member, can I split my daily complimentary parking privileges across multiple visits on the same day? No, the daily complimentary parking hour(s) for Gold and Platinum members shall not be prorated based on the actual amount of time parked. The full hours of free parking (1 hour for Gold member and 2 hours for Platinum member) will be utilised upon the member’s first exit from the carpark during the day (i.e. if a Gold member parks for 30 minutes, the full hours of free 1 hour parking will be utilised upon his exit. Member would not be able to enjoy the remaining 30 mins of free parking for his second visit on the same day). How do I enjoy the free parking benefits with minimum spend for all tiers? Input or update your In-Vehicle Unit (IU) number in your Changi Rewards profile through the Changi App. In the event if there is no IU number registered to the Changi Reward’s member profile, the member will not receive the parking benefit.​ Visit and spend at participating outlets in Changi Airport and Jewel Changi Airport. ​ Scan your Rewards Card upon the point of purchase at the participating outlets in order to qualify for the accumulative nett spend. ​ Free parking benefits will be automatically credited to member’s IU once the required minimum spend amount is accumulated. ​ Parking charges equivalent to the free parking hours will automatically be offset from your parking charges when you exit the car park. ​ Find out more on the free parking benefits with minimum spend here .

If I had made 3 transactions within the same day at participating outlets in T1 to T4 which sums up to S$60 (all 3 transactions with Rewards Card scanned), will the 2 hours free parking benefit be automatically credited to my Changi Rewards account? Yes, it will be automatically credited and reflected under My CarPass > My eCoupons provided that Rewards Card was scanned for all 3 transactions. To avoid any inconvenience, do remember to scan your Rewards Card at each point of transaction. If I spend S$50 at T1 to T4 and S$30 at Jewel, where cumulatively would have totalled up to S$80, will I still qualify for the 2 hours free parking? No, accumulative spend at T1 to T4 and Jewel cannot be combined. 2 hours free parking is valid for S$60 accumulative nett spend at T1 to T4 Public Areas and/or S$80 accumulative nett spend at Jewel Changi Airport. If I spend at Jewel, will I be able to utilise my 2 hours free parking at Terminal car parks? No, accumulated spend at Jewel can only qualify for 2 hours free parking at T1-Jewel carpark (General parking lots – B3 to B5) only. If I park between 2 May (entry) and 3 May (exit), and I meet the qualifying spends for both days (2 May and 3 May), can I utilise a total of 4 hours of free parking upon my exit at the applicable carpark on 3 May? No, only one parking benefit of 2 hours free parking can be utilised upon each exit.

The non-participating outlets for Changi Rewards parking benefits is the same as the exclusion list for earning of Changi Rewards points. You may refer to clause 4.8 of Changi Rewards T&Cs for the full list of non-participating outlets. I have existing parking rebates redeemed with Changi Rewards points on top of the redeemed 2 hours free parking with minimum spend, which parking benefit will be utilised first upon my exit? Based on the order of priority for parking benefits and eCoupons, the free parking benefit with minimum spend shall be applied first, followed by your existing parking rebates. ​ Members are encouraged to verify through CarPass, the eligible parking redemptions, privileges or benefits available to them. The order of priority is subjected to changes and members may refer to https://carpass.changiairport.com/FAQ.html for latest updates. What happens if I have changes to my vehicle details, such as a new license plate number or IU number? Should there be a need to amend the In-vehicle Unit (IU) number, you can update your vehicle details using My CarPass portal. Do note that the IU number registered in your Changi Rewards membership account will be updated accordingly with the updated IU number and this update will apply to all of your existing eCoupons, parking privileges and parking rebates, as well as future parking redemptions made via My CarPass portal. Can I register multiple IU numbers to my Changi Rewards account? No, you may only register one IU number to your Changi Rewards account. Each IU number can only be registered to an individual Changi Rewards account. If the IU numbers belongs to a shared vehicle, you may first remove the IU from the original Changi Rewards account before updating it onto another Changi Rewards account. What should I do if my Changi Rewards parking benefits are not deducted at the valid Carparks?

Get Changi App now FAQS Participating Airlines What is the Changi Baggage Tracker? The baggage tracker is a service by CAG to provide departing, arriving and transferring passengers with status updates of their bags as they travel through Changi Airport. I have keyed in my bag tag number but my bag cannot be found. Your airline(s) may not be participating on the baggage tracker (see here for list of participating airlines), but we are continually working with the airlines operating at Changi Airport to bring as many airlines onboard as possible. If you believe that this is an error, please email enquiry@changiairport.com , or give feedback through the widget found in the baggage tracker. How long after my flight would I be able to track my bags? Up to 3 days. Is this service different from the baggage tracking provided by my airline? The information provided by your airline and our tracker could be similar. Your airline may provide additional information only available to them, while our tracker may have information displayed that is integrated with our airport facilities. What does “loaded” mean? The “loaded” status refers to your checked-in bags being placed into containers / trolleys bound for your departing aircraft. How are the bags tracked? The Changi Baggage Tracker utilises a combination of information provided by the airline you travel on and Changi Airport’s baggage system to provide you with a journey of your bags through Changi Airport. I’m a transfer passenger, why does the tracker show that my bags will be delivered to a belt in Changi Airport? Please check at the transfer counter to confirm that your bags have been checked through to the final destination.

If you do not have an existing Changi Rewards membership, you may sign up before the point of purchase here: https://changi.me/mcchangiapp and scan your Changi Rewards Card upon payment. Changi Rewards Card must be scanned upon point of purchase, to receive the Changi Return e-Vouchers in member’s account. To redeem the e-Voucher, simply: Flash your Changi Rewards card and a valid boarding pass. The Shilla Duty Free and Lotte Duty Free cashiers will scan your Changi Rewards card to apply the Changi Return e-Vouchers to your transaction. The Changi Return e-Voucher may only be redeemed at The Shilla Duty Free and Lotte Duty Free in-stores within Departure Hall (Terminals 1-4) only, on your next flight out of Changi Airport. It is not applicable on iShopChangi. It also cannot be used for purchase of any tobacco products. Product exclusions may apply. Who are the participating outlets for this promotion? All transit F&B and retail outlets within Transit areas (Terminal 1 – 4). The promotion does not apply to the purchase of services. How can I qualify for the promotion? You will qualify for the promotion if you meet the S$100 minimum spend in a single receipt for participating stores in Transit, AND are an existing Changi Rewards member. This is because the Changi Return e-Voucher will be issued to you via the Changi App. If you do not have an existing Changi Rewards membership, you may sign up before the point of purchase, and scan your Rewards Card upon payment. Rewards Card must be scanned upon point of purchase, to receive the Changi Return e-Vouchers in member’s account. Must I be a Singaporean to enjoy this promotion? No, you do not. To qualify for the promotion, you only need to meet the minimum spends to be issued the Changi Return e-Voucher. If I spend S$200 in two separate receipts, will I be entitled to 2 x S$10 Changi Return e-Vouchers? Qualification is based on the minimum spend in one receipt per Changi Rewards member per day . You will not be able to combine receipts to hit the minimum spend, or receive more than two S$10 Changi Return e-Vouchers on the same day. As such, so long as you meet the S$100 minimum spend in a single receipt , you will be awarded with a S$10 Changi Return e-Voucher in a day. Is the promotion limited to one Changi Return e-Voucher per customer? Each Changi Rewards member who meets the minimum spend is entitled to one Changi Return e-Voucher issued per day. If the Changi Rewards member meets the minimum spend on a second receipt on another day, the customer can still receive a second S$10 Changi Return e-Voucher. I qualified for the promotion and received the Changi Return e-Voucher to my Changi Rewards account. On my next trip out of Singapore, I redeemed the e-Voucher. At the same time, I had met the minimum spend in Transit, in a single receipt. Will I be issued another Changi Return e-Voucher for this transaction? Yes, each Changi Rewards member will be rewarded with one Changi Return e-Voucher per day. If the Changi Rewards member travels out of Singapore 5 times during campaign period, the member can receive 5 x $10 Changi Return e-Voucher (provided he meets the minimum spend on each trip). This is also subject to the Changi Return e-Vouchers still being available for giving out. How will the Changi Return e-Voucher be issued? Once you qualify, the Changi Return e-Voucher will be automatically issued into your Changi Rewards Account, which you may access through the Changi App. The Changi Return e-Voucher will be found under ‘Vouchers, Prizes & Redemptions’ in your Changi App account. I qualified for the promotion by meeting the minimum spend, but I do not see the Changi Return e-Voucher in my Changi Rewards account. Why? The Changi Return e-Voucher will automatically be issued to your Changi Rewards account via the Changi App after 24 hours after the qualifying purchase is made. If the Changi Return e-Voucher does not appear after 24 hours, please submit your enquiry through our online form here: https://www.changiairport.com/en/rewards/feedback.html Where can I redeem the Changi Return e-Voucher? The Changi Return e-Voucher may only be redeemed at The Shilla Duty Free and Lotte Duty Free in-stores within Departure Hall (Terminals 1-4) only. It is not applicable on iShopChangi. It also cannot be used for purchase of any tobacco products. How can I redeem the Changi Return e-Voucher? You will receive an ‘offer’ on Changi App, which will direct you to your Changi Rewards card. To redeem the Changi Return e-Voucher, simply flash your Changi Rewards card to Shilla and Lotte cashiers to scan your Changi Rewards card to apply the Changi Return e-Vouchers to your transaction. I have accumulated multiple Changi Return e-Vouchers in my Changi Rewards card. Can I stack the vouchers? No, the Changi Return e-Vouchers cannot be stacked in a single receipt. The Changi Return e-Vouchers can be redeemed on a 1 per Changi Rewards member per transaction basis. Therefore, if you have 5 Changi Return e-Vouchers in your Changi Rewards account you may utilise all 5 Changi Return e-Vouchers on the same day, so long as you make 5 transactions in the same day. Are there any brand exclusions? For The Shilla Duty Free, brand exclusions are Chanel and Dior. There are no brand exclusions for Lotte Duty Free, except that the Changi Return e-Vouchers cannot be used for purchase of any tobacco products. If I use Changi Pay e-Voucher and Changi Rewards Points to off-set my purchases, will the amount still count towards the min spend and/or accumulated nett spend? No. The application of Changi Pay e-Vouchers and Changi Rewards Points, and other in-store promotions, discounts and/or offers, cannot be counted towards the minimum spend and/or accumulated nett spend.

Vulnerability Disclosure Policy The safety and security of our stakeholders’ data (including customers, employees, partners and suppliers), and the reliability of our products and services, are important to Changi Airport Group (S) Pte. Ltd. (“CAG”). Therefore, we aim to design and develop products and services with high levels of security and reliability. Despite our best efforts, due to the complex and sophisticated nature of our products and services, vulnerabilities and errors may still be present. CAG’s vulnerability disclosure program is part of our efforts to enhance its cybersecurity posture, especially as it relates to our products and services. This VDP describes CAG’s vulnerability disclosure program and sets out CAG’s approach to requesting and receiving reports related to potential vulnerabilities and errors in our products and services. This VDP also outlines the terms and conditions for responsible vulnerability reporting. Products and services in this VDP refer to digital products and services provided by CAG through [ https://www.changiairport.com and https://www.ishopchangi.com/ ]. Please note that CAG’s vulnerability disclosure program does not authorise, permit or endorse the taking of any action which may contravene applicable laws and regulations such as the Computer Misuse Act 1993. For the avoidance of doubt, any attempt to exploit or test suspected vulnerabilities such as by gaining unauthorised access to any computer/data is strictly prohibited, and neither permitted nor encouraged. To report a vulnerability, please click on the ‘Submit a report’ button at the bottom of this page. Please note that reporting any vulnerability or error (including supplying your personal data and contact information) is entirely voluntary. By submitting a report, you hereby consent for your personal data (including your name, email address) to be collected, used and/or disclosed by members of the CAG Group to assess the report that you have submitted and for the purposes set out in Changi Airport Group (Singapore) Pte. Ltd.'s ( CAG ) Privacy Policy. TERMS AND CONDITIONS By submitting a report to CAG , or otherwise communicating to CAG regarding any vulnerabilities and errors, you agree that: CAG may use your report for any purpose deemed relevant by CAG , including without limitation, to correct any vulnerabilities and errors that you report, and without any attribution, credit or remuneration to you or any consultation with you. You have not exploited or used in any manner, and will not exploit or use in any manner other than for the purposes of reporting to CAG , the discovered vulnerabilities and/or errors. You have not engaged, and will not engage, in any actions (including testing/reconnaissance of systems) with the intention of harming CAG , its customers, employees, partners or suppliers. You have not used, misused, deleted, altered or destroyed, and will not use, misuse, delete, alter or destroy, any data that you have accessed or may be able to access in relation to the vulnerability and/or error discovered. You have not conducted, and will not conduct social engineering, spamming, phishing, denial-of-service or resource-exhaustion attacks, as it relates to CAG’s products and services. You have not breached, and will not breach, any applicable laws (such as the Computer Misuse Act 1993) in relation to and in connection with the submission of your report to CAG. You will not disclose to any third party any information related to your report, the vulnerabilities and/or errors reported, nor the fact that a vulnerability and/or error has been reported to CAG . CAG does not guarantee that you will receive any response from CAG related to your report. CAG will only contact your regarding your report if CAG (at its absolute discretion) deems it necessary. You agree that you are making your report without any expectation or requirement of reward or other benefit, financial or otherwise, and without any expectation that the vulnerabilities and/or errors reported are corrected by CAG. You will comply with the Code of Conduct for Participants of CAG’s Vulnerability Disclosure Programme. CAG shall not be liable for any expense, damage or loss of any kind which you may incur due to any action taken or not taken by us in relation to any vulnerability or error you may report. CAG shall not accept or assume any responsibility for the contents of any report you submit, or shall our acknowledgment or processing of such report constitute any kind of acceptance or endorsements of the contents of your report. A proof of concept regarding the reported vulnerability should not be malicious in nature, for example, but not limited to the following: tampering of existing data in database, adding bogus records in the database, or deletion of records. In the case where SQL injection vulnerability exist, querying for the version of database would be sufficient to demonstrate the ability to read database. Enumerating the existing rights in context of the SQL server session is also allowed. In time-based SQL context, showing that the response time varies and correspond to the different values set in sleep function would suffice. Showing hostname is sufficient for RCE vulnerabilities.

CODE OF CONDUCT FOR PARTICIPANTS OF CAG’S VULNERABILITY DISCLOSURE PROGRAMME Participants should act responsibly and with the sole purpose of reporting suspected vulnerabilities and errors.

Participants shall not attempt to exfiltrate any computer data or publish details or publicly disclose any suspected vulnerabilities or errors to any third party apart from CAG.
